    "## 1. Summation Notation\n",
    "### 1.1 General Notation\n",
    "It is important that we are comfortable with reading and manipulating mathematical formulas that involve sums. In order to more efficiently denote sums, especially sums over long sequences, we can use summation notation, also known as sigma notation due to the use of the the Greek letter \"sigma\": $\\Sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several elements involved in summation notation. First, consider a sequence of n numbers $x_0, x_1, \\cdots x_{n-1}$. We will start our index at 0, to remain in accordance with Python/Numpy's index system. $x_0$ is the first number in the sequence, $x_1$ is the second number in the sequence, and so forth, so $x_j$ is the general $j+1$ number in the sequence. We will utilize this $j$ index in our summation notation. Suppose we were to calculate the sum of all $n$ of these numbers in the sequence. We write that this sum is equivalent to \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x_j = x_0+x_1+ \\cdots x_{n-1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Let's parse this equation. $\\Sigma$ is the summation sign, indicating that we are summing a sequence. $j$ is the index of summation that is being iterated over; $j$ is being used to subscript $x$. Then, we start our summation at 0 because the lower bound on our sum is set as $j=0$. The upper bound for our sum, or our stopping point is written as $n-1$, which is equivalent to writing $j=n-1$ on top of the $\\Sigma$ symbol. Then, $x_j$ indicates the quantitiy that we are summing. One way to think about this is in terms of a for-loop. This summation concept is equivalent to a for loop for all integers in the range from the lower bound to the upper bound, indexed into the sequence $x$. Then, the code for our previous sum is:\n",

Then, we can calculate the sum of the product of each value in A with each value in B (a sum over $m\\times n$ products).
